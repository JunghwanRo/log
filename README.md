# DONE
Check the one-page summaries of all keynotes @ ICRA40. \
Check the schedule of ICRA@40 and make proper plan. \

Check joint control options in Isaac Lab. (set_effort, set_velocity, set_pos) \
Get Official Transcripts. \
Check HW4 for Graduate Algorithms \
Check if there is a provided way to log variables during play.py - DONE by connecting ROS2, and foxglove., Simulation Data Visualizer \
Book ICRA@40 Accommodation. \
