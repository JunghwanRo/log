# To be DONE
Read paper "Learning Quadruped Locomotion Using Differentiable Simulation". \
Make action smooth. \
Train Hovering+Yaw Task, and check the validity of acquired data. \
Check which part of the code prevents a smooth shutdown. \
Modularize the rewards so we can turn it on and off. \
Reading Between Sea and Sky: Aerial Aquatic Locomotion in Miniature Robots (Now on Section 1.1.5) \
Change to Norm of everything (Position, Orientation). \


# DONE
Meeting with Luis for IROS Poster. \
Book IELTS or TOEFL. \
Add the rotor motor state and twist to the log. \
Check the trained data and visualize it with an ipynb file. \
Make the active joint realistic. \
Make a 2-page slide for the SPEAR meeting. \
Make a brief Introductory PPT/Video. \
ICRA@40. \
Check the one-page summaries of all keynotes @ ICRA40. \
Check the schedule of ICRA@40 and make proper plan. \
Save log files, such as ROSBAG, with isaac sim. - This was done, but to record actions as well, anyway, I had to write a code for saving a CSV.\
Request Meetings for the Swiss Robotics Day. \
CS6515 writes a working version of the code for HW4. \
Make Action smooth. - First, try using a simple action-prev_action difference penalty. \
Review Steffen's PhD defense preparation slides. \
Check joint control options in Isaac Lab. (set_effort, set_velocity, set_pos) \
Get Official Transcripts. \
Check HW4 for Graduate Algorithms \
Check if there is a provided way to log variables during play.py - DONE by connecting ROS2, and foxglove., Simulation Data Visualizer \
Book ICRA@40 Accommodation. \
Summarize ICRA@40 interesting session. \
DREAM Lab Meeting (24.09.17) \
Check the narrow gap passage task with a simple setting. (Run 115, FoldableDrone) \
Check the Diagonal motor distance of models. (Reconfigurable ~44, Foldable > 60)
